# Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using Create React App (CRA), Axios, Redux, React-Toastify, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for a city and get the current weather data for that location.

## Installation

To install this app, first clone this repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, run the following command:

### `npm start`

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To search for a city's weather, simply type the city name in the input field and press enter or click on the "Search" button. The app will then fetch the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it on the page.

If there is an error with the API call, such as an invalid city name or network error, the app will display an error message using React-Toastify.
